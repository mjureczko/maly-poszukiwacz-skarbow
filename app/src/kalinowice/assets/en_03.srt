1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,900
We are in DÄ…browa

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,900
a pre-war farm

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,900
The object may seem inconspicuous

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,900
but history has left a dramatic mark on it

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,900
According to some, tragic events took place here

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,900
during the Silesian Uprising

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,900
A unit of scouts - insurgents

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,900
died here

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,900
and their bodies were drowned

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,900
in one of the farm wells

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,900
After the war

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,900
a unit of Hubertus' Black Wolves - Hitler's last soldiers

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,900
found shelter here

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,900
German partisans who led a terrorist fight

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,900
immediately after World War II

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,900
Here they tried to organize a secret weapons warehouse

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,900
But there is nothing to fear

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,900
the members of the organization were arrested a long time ago

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,900
and the military equipment was removed from here
