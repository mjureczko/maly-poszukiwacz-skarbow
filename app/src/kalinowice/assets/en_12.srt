1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,900
The Elsner von Gronow family

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,900
owned Kalinowice for about 100 years

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,900
but you won't find their graves

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,900
in the nearby cemeteries

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,900
What could have happened to them?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,900
The earls were not Catholics

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,900
so they wouldn't choose a Catholic cemetery

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,900
for their final resting place

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,900
They created their own

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,900
small cemetery

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,900
on their estate

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,900
It is located in the Kalinowice park

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,900
which unfortunately is currently closed

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,900
A few tombstones

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,900
and the ruins of a chapel

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,900
have survived there to this day
