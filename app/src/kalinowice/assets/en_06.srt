00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,900
Back in the 19th century

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,900
the most popular food product in these region were groats

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,900
Do you like fries?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,900
But you can't make fries from groats

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,900
Fortunately, culinary habits have been changed

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,900
by the actions of innovators promoting novelties such as potatoes.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,900
Kalinowice, thanks to the earls von Gronow

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,900
who ruled here at that time

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,900
became the precursor of growing this vegetable

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,900
which is necessary for the production of French fries

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,900
This appetizing story is commemorated

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,900
by the potato digger seen here

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,900
The fact that the digger was manufactured

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,900
in an agricultural machinery factory in nearby Strzelce Opolskie

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,900
adds additional historical attractivity

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,900
This factory no longer exists

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,900
but in its heyday it was

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,900
the largest plant of this type

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,900
in the country

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,900
and the only one producing potato diggers
