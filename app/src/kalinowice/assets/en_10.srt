1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,900
We are now standing in front of

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,900
the most unusual chapel in Kalinowice

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,900
the Eye of Providence

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,900
It is meant to remind us

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,900
that God sees all our actions

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,900
both good and bad

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,900
But Iâ€™m sure that on this trip

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,900
everyone has been well-behaved

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,900
and there have only been

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,900
good actions to see
