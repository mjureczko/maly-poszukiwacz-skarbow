00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,900
In old times

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,900
the life cycle of village inhabitants was determined by prayers

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,900
Since few people had a watch back then

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,900
bells calling for prayer were needed

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,900
The bell visible here is a remnant of those times

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,900
To this day, he calls for the Angelus at 6, 12 and 6 p.m.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,900
The inhabitants know it as the bell of the dead

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,900
This is because it also rings with a call

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,900
to pray for the souls of inhabitants

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,900
who have passed away from this world
