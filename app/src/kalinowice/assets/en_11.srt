1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,900
We are now in a special place.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,900
Adults will find lots of interesting facts about Kalinowice

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:010,900
on the historical board here

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,900
which I helped create

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,900
For the younger ones

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,900
I invite you to spend

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,900
some unforgettable moments

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,900
at the playground across the square

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,900
Right next to us

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,900
is the Volunteer Fire Department station

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,900
so don't be surprised

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,900
if you suddenly hear a loud siren

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,900
and see a fire truck rushing out with its lights on

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,900
Years ago

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,900
a police car from the militia

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,900
could also rush out from here

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,900
This building used to be a police station and jail

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,900
The policeman could act like a sheriff

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,900
taking action with a weapon

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,900
and putting suspects behind bars
