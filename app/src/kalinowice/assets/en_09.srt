1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,900
For many years

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,900
one of the biggest prides of Kalinowice

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,400
has been one of the oldest

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,900
ginkgo trees in the country

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,900
This exotic tree was probably brought here

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,900
by the von Gronow family a long time ago

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,900
Take a look at its leaves

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,900
What do they remind you of?

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,900
Have you seen them somewhere before?

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,900
The ginkgo leaf has become

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,900
the unofficial symbol of the village

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,900
and you might have seen it on

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,900
the welcome signs at the entrance to Kalinowice

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,900
Unfortunately, the last few years

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,900
have not been kind to our prized tree

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,900
It was struck by lightning

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,900
causing one of its main branches to fall off

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,900
and we don't know what will happen to it in the future

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,900
Ginkgo trees are very useful

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,900
They are used to make medicines

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,900
that can help prevent strokes

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,900
and improve memory
