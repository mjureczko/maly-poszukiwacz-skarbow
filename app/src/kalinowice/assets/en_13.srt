1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,900
The school building you see here

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,900
is quite new

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,900
so you might be surprised

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,900
to learn that a school

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,900
has been in Kalinowice for over 100 years

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,900
The first school was on Wiejska Street

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,900
but it quickly became too small

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,900
for all the kids

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,900
who wanted to learn

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,900
The second school was built

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,900
right here in the 1930s

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,900
I actually went to this school

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,900
Here you can see me

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,900
in a picture from

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,900
the end of the school year

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,900
The picture shows

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,900
an interesting local tradition where

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,900
7th graders say goodbye

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,900
to the 8th graders

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,900
who are leaving school

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,900
Can anyone spot me in the picture?

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,900
When I finished school

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,900
there were so many students

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,900
that they needed an extra building in KalinÃ³w

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,900
to fit everyone

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,900
About 20 years ago

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,900
the school was expanded

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,900
to look like it does now

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,900
Unfortunately, in recent years

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,900
there have been fewer children

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,900
and the authorities decided

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,900
that keeping such a big school

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,900
was too expensive

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,900
Now, only part of the building is used

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,900
and it's just a preschool
