1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,900
Does Kalinowice have a resident who visits Africa every year?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,900
Of course, it's our stork!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,900
Storks are birds that fly to warm countries for the winter

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,900
They spend the coldest months in Egypt

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,900
and if they have the inclination to travel further

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,900
they can reach Uganda, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Sudan

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,900
or even South Africa

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,900
Take a look at our stork

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,900
does he look like a fan of long journeys?

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,900
There is also an interesting story behind the nest itself

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,900
It was originally located in a barn

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,900
that was destroyed by fire

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,400
However, the inhabitants of Kalinowice

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,900
were so attached to the stork

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,900
that they moved its nest to a pole

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,900
where it is located to this day
