1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,900
To find this treasure

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,900
you had to walk along the historic linden alley

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,900
the trees there are over 300 years old

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,900
Do you see the cross here?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,900
Next to it, there is a stone in which

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,900
miraculously, someone has left footprints

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,900
A legend explains how this happened

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,900
Supposedly, a man once passed through here

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,900
and cursed God

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,900
God was so angry with him

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,900
that threw a thunderbolt

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,900
which struck the man

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,900
leaving his feet imprinted on the stone

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,900
This legend was repeated

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,900
in the form of a caricature

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,900
at a time when instead of policemen

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,900
we had militiamen in our country

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,900
An officer wanted to confront God

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,900
He pulled out his service pistol

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,900
and shot twice at the image of Christ

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,900
The bullet holes are still there

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,900
but other than that

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,900
it didn't hurt God
