1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,900
We are in the part of Kalinowice

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,900
called Dolna Lipa or Lipieniec

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,900
This name comes

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,900
from the impressive linden tree

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,900
a natural monument growing in the place

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,900
where St. Anne's Mountain seems to end

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,900
Notice how the sloping terrain

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,900
becomes flat here

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,900
Dolna Lipa was founded before World War II

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,900
by the German authorities

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,900
At that time

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,900
8 farms were created

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,900
for settlers from Westfallia

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,900
6 of them remain today

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,900
unfortunately 2 of them burned down

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,900
The pre-war inhabitants

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,900
fled from here fearing the Red Army

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,900
and their place was taken by

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,900
"Kresowiacy" right after the war
