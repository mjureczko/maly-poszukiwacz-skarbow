1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Do you know where Sweden is?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's far away from here

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
300 years ago, Sweden had strong soldiers

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
They were called cuirassiers — feared in all Europe

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Back then, there were no cars or planes

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The cuirassiers came here during big wars

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Like the Northern War and the Swedish Deluge

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Even earlier, they came in another war

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
a very bloody one: the Thirty Years’ War

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Many people died back then.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This little chapel helps us remember them.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
There was a town here called Gorzowy.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It burned down

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
during the fighting.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Later, only ruins were found in the forest.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Maybe you’ll find more one day!
