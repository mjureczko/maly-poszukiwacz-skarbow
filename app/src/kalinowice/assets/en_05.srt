1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,900
Have you heard about the Swedish Deluge?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,900
Despite what the name might suggest

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,900
it was a terrible war

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,900
that took place nearly 400 years ago

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,900
It claimed many victims

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,900
and the shrine visible here

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,900
is intended to perpetuate their memory

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,900
It is also worth mentioning

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,900
that a town called Gorzowy was located somewhere in the fields here

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,900
During the military operations

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,900
it burned down completely

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,900
and now it is not certain

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,900
where exactly the buildings were located

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,900
Maybe one of you will become an archaeologist one day

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,900
and will be able to find its trace
