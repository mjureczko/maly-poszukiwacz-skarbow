00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,900
Welcome to Kalinowice

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,900
a town whose name may come from the viburnum

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
However, this is not certain

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,000
As there isn't much of this plant around

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,000
On the other hand

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,000
the first historical owners of the village

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,000
were the Kalinowski family

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,000
And the name of the town may come from their surname

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,000
It was long time ago

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,000
The Kalinowski family has been gone

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,000
from Kalinowice for over 200 years

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,000
Only a few traces of their presence remain

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,000
Their graves can be found in the crypt

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,000
in the sanctuary on Saint Anne's Mountain

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,000
and in the church in nearby KalinÃ³w

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,000
there is a monstrance funded by them

17
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,000
which, due to its great historical value

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,000
is not available to visitors

19
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,000
There is no certainty about the origin of the name Kalinowce

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm betting on the Kalinowski family

21
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,100
What do you think?
